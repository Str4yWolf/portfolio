        <h1>Hey everyone, I'm Michael.</h1>
        <p>
        
            I've been a <strong>passionate web developer for 2 years</strong> and have a Computer Science background. My biggest fields of interest include productivity tools, e-learning, and information and communication platforms.
            <br />
            <br />
                I enjoy <strong>collaborating</strong> with different and diverse teams as they provide a great environment to exchange new ideas and grow one's field of vision.
            <br />
            <br />
                My vision is to <strong>contribute</strong> to human society as a driver of growth and also to encourage interdisciplinary and intercultural interaction, as I believe we can learn a lot from one another.
            <br />
            <br />
                In general, I'd describe myself as a passionate <strong>problem solver</strong> with a knack for cultures, languages, and travel. I also like to contemplate life and try to get the most out of it - e.g., through life hacks.
